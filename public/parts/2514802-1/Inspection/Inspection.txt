Inspection Tools (we need to talk about how we go about this set up) [also need to talk about the pictures, we shouldn't need to take a pic of calipers or micrometers every time or even the chamfer gage {or maybe we do?} that could be standard, but we need a pic of the Hone Gage at it's setting...Or Do we ? maybe not]
	 -All these pics could probably be standard since we will have unique pics at the top section.
1. Calipers (any...0-6 would be standard I suppose, but min 0-4 [if they make that?])
2. 0-1 Micrometers
3. 3-4 Micrometers
4. 2-3 0-90 Degree Chamfer Gage
5. Hone Gage set to 2.201 (+.0005 -.0025)
6. Depth Micrometers (any min 0-1, probably standard 0-6 I think)

All pics (Do we need this?)
1. All inspection items.
